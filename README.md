These are various codes to use CORDIC Algorihm in various ways.

You can use it to get the reciprocal of a number -> Reciprocal CORDIC

You can use it to rotate a vector -> Rotational CORDIC

You can use it to get the magnitude of a vector -> Vectoring CORDIC

You can use it to get the sin and the cos of an input angle and many other trignometric and hyperbolic functions
